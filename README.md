# TPGwidget
TPGwidget is an iOS/Android app for public transport in Geneva. It uses the free Open Data API provided by the transit operator ([transports publics genevois](https://www.tpg.ch/)).

TPGwidget includes many features such as :
- stops shortcuts on the home screen
- real-time lines schedules
- routes planning
- vehicles informations
- and much more!

The projet is made with [Framework7](http://framework7.io) in the front end, and PHP in the back end. The app users download on the [App Store](https://github.com/tpgwidget/ios) or on [Google Play](https://github.com/tpgwidget/android) is powered by Apache Cordova.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites : PHP 7+, MySQL, Node.js (dev only)

### Install

To run an instance of TPGwidget, you have to :
1. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file named `.env` and fill in your TPG Open Data API key and your database credentials.
2. Create on your MySQL Server the required tables (use the `dump.sql` file)

On the production server,
- https://tpg.nicolapps.ch is linked to the `tpg` folder. It contains the iOS web app.
- https://tpga.nicolapps.ch is linked to the `tpga` folder. It contains the Android web app.
- https://tpgdata.nicolapps.ch is linked to the `tpgdata` folder. It contains generic data (maps, vehicles images)

### Develop
Front-end files are compiled with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com). To install it, use `npm install gulp-cli -g` from the command line. You can then compile the assets using `gulp ios-css`, `gulp android-css`, `gulp ios-js` and `gulp android-js`.
